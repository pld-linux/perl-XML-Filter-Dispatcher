%description
B<WARNING>: Beta code alert.

A SAX2 filter that dispatches SAX events based on "EventPath" patterns
as the SAX events arrive.  The SAX events are not buffered or converted
to an in-memory document representation like a DOM tree.  This provides
for low lag operation because the actions associated with each pattern
are executed as soon as possible, usually in an element's
C<start_element()> event method.

This differs from traditional XML pattern matching tools like
XPath and XSLT (which is XPath-based) which require the entire
document to be built in memory (as a "DOM tree") before queries can be
executed.  In SAX terms, this means that they have to build a DOM tree
from SAX events and delay pattern matching until the C<end_document()>
event method is called.
